          <h2>Pre-Colonial Timeline</h2>
          <br>
          <ul><li>Early Settlements (9000 BCE - 1500 BCE): Archaeological evidence points to settlements in Ile-Ife dating back to the 10th to 6th century BCE, with the city transitioning into an urban center around the 4th to 7th centuries CE. By the 8th century, a powerful city-state had formed, laying the foundation for the Ife Empire (circa 1200-1420).</li></ul>
          <br>
          <ul><li>Emergence of Kingdoms (1500 BCE - 1068 CE): Numerous ancient African civilizations settled in the region, such as the Kingdom of Nri, the Benin Kingdom, and the Oyo Empire. Islam reached Nigeria through the Bornu Empire between 1068 CE and the Hausa Kingdom during the 11th century.</li></ul>
          <br>
          <ul><li>Formation of Empires (1200-1420 CE): The Ife Empire grew under figures like Oduduwa, revered as the first divine king of the Yoruba. Ile-Ife, its capital, rose to prominence, with its influence extending across southwestern Nigeria. The period between 1200 and 1400 is often referred to as the "golden age" of Ile-Ife.</li></ul>
          <br>
          <ul><li>Expansions and Conflicts (1400-1800 CE): The history of Borno antedates the 9th century, when Arabic writers noted the kingdom of Kanem, east of Lake Chad. The city-states of Nembe, Elem Kalabari, Bonny, and Okrika emerged along the coast after 1480 and were involved in the transatlantic slave trade.</li></ul>
          <br>
          <ul><li>Internal Conflicts and Wars (1700-1800 CE): The Igbo-Igala Wars, driven by territorial disputes and political power struggles, occurred in the 18th and 19th centuries.</li></ul>
